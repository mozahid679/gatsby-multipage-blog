          <h1 class="title">Digital image processing</h1>
          <p>
            In computer science, digital image processing is the use of computer
            algorithms to perform image processing on digital images. As a
            subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image
            processing has many advantages over analog image processing. It
            allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input
            data and can avoid problems such as the build-up of noise and signal
            distortion during processing. Since images are defined over two
            dimensions (perhaps more) digital image processing may be modeled in
            the form of multidimensional systems.

          <h2>History</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Many of the techniques of digital image processing, or digital
            picture processing as it often was called, were developed in the
            1960s at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of
            Technology, Bell Laboratories, University of Maryland, and a few
            other research facilities, with application to satellite imagery,
            wire-photo standards conversion, medical imaging, videophone,
            character recognition, and photograph enhancement. The cost of
            processing was fairly high, however, with the computing equipment of
            that era.

          <p>
            That changed in the 1970s, when digital image processing
            proliferated as cheaper computers and dedicated hardware became
            available. Images then could be processed in real time, for some
            dedicated problems such as television standards conversion. As
            general-purpose computers became faster, they started to take over
            the role of dedicated hardware for all but the most specialized and
            computer-intensive operations. With the fast computers and signal
            processors available in the 2000s, digital image processing has
            become the most common form of image processing and generally, is
            used because it is not only the most versatile method, but also the
            cheapest.

            Digital image processing technology for medical applications was
            inducted into the Space Foundation Space Technology Hall of Fame in
            1994.
